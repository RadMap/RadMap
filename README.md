# RadMap

Current version v1.1.0

## About RadMap
RadMap is a software that allows you to simulate how radiation interacts with matter. With RadMap you describe an environment in terms of geometrical objects and sources of radiation. RadMap then uses a full Monte Carlo algorithm to calculate the effects of radiation in desired points of your environment.

With RadMap you can

   * calculate external gamma dose due to a large number of radioactive isotopes in complex geometries
   * define new materials if the many predefined materials do not suite your needs
   * save your geometries and sources for later use and sharing
